# Running ChEMBL pipelines

This document describes how to run the main ChEMBL-based pipelines from
the BioETL CLI.

It focuses on the conceptual contracts and typical options rather than
exhaustive flag listings.

## Pipelines covered

The following pipelines are typically exposed via dedicated run
commands:

- `activity_chembl` — activity records and bioactivity measurements.
- `assay_chembl` — assay-level metadata.
- `target_chembl` — target entities and related components.
- `document_chembl` — supporting documents and literature metadata.
- `testitem_chembl` — tested items such as compounds or batches.
- `chembl_all` — orchestration command to run all ChEMBL pipelines.

Exact command names and options may vary between versions; always check
`--help` output for your installation.

## Typical single-pipeline run

A representative pattern for running a single pipeline looks like this:

```bash
bioetl run activity_chembl \
  --config configs/pipelines/activity/example.yaml
```

In this example:

- `bioetl` is the CLI entry point (replace with the actual one in your
  environment if it differs).
- `activity_chembl` is the pipeline code.
- `--config` points to a typed YAML configuration file.

Real commands may accept additional options such as profile selection or
runtime overrides.

## Running all ChEMBL pipelines

An orchestration command can be used to run all ChEMBL pipelines in a
single invocation.

A conceptual example:

```bash
bioetl run chembl_all \
  --config configs/pipelines/chembl/all.yaml
```

Implementations may choose a different command structure or naming, but
the idea remains the same: a single command performs a coordinated run
of all relevant ChEMBL pipelines.

## Golden runs and determinism

Project rules define a `--golden` flag that triggers byte-for-byte
comparison of outputs and QC artifacts against pre-recorded golden
artifacts.

A typical pattern is:

```bash
bioetl run activity_chembl \
  --config configs/pipelines/activity/example.yaml \
  --golden
```

When `--golden` is used, any deviation from the golden artifacts should
result in a non-zero exit code, causing CI to fail.

## Recommendations

- Prefer explicit, version-controlled configuration files rather than
  long ad-hoc command lines.
- Use golden runs for critical pipelines in CI to guard against
  regressions.
- Keep run commands idempotent so they can be safely retried.
