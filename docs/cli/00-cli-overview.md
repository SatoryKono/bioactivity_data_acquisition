# CLI overview

The BioETL command-line interface (CLI) is the primary way to run
pipelines, validate configurations, and integrate with automation tools
such as CI.

This document provides a high-level overview of the CLI design and how
it relates to configuration and project rules.

## Entry points

The CLI is implemented using Typer and exposed through a static
registry of commands.

Depending on your installation, you may invoke the CLI via a console
script (for example `bioetl`) or by running the module directly (for
example `python -m bioetl.cli`).

In the examples below, `bioetl` is used as a placeholder for whatever
entry point is configured in your environment.

## Design principles

- Explicit commands and flags
  - Prefer explicit named options over ambiguous positional arguments.
- Deterministic behavior
  - Identical inputs and configuration should lead to byte-identical
    outputs.
- Idempotent commands
  - Running the same command twice with the same inputs should not
    produce conflicting or inconsistent artifacts.
- Clear exit codes
  - Successful commands exit with code `0`.
  - Validation or runtime errors result in non-zero exit codes that can
    be checked in CI.

## Relationship to IDE commands

In the development environment, convenience commands may be exposed as
IDE slash commands (for example `/run-activity-chembl` or
`/run-chembl-all`).

These commands are thin wrappers around the same underlying CLI
functionality described in this section and should follow the same
contracts for flags, determinism, and exit codes.

## Logging and observability

All CLI commands are expected to:

- Initialize a unified run context (for example `run_id`, `pipeline`,
  `stage`, `dataset`, `source`).
- Emit structured logs via UnifiedLogger instead of using `print` or raw
  logging calls.

This ensures that pipeline runs are observable and can be audited in
production and CI environments.
