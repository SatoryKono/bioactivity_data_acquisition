- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within **7 days**
- **Regular Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve security issues within **30 days** of acknowledgment

### Security Response Process

1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge the report and begin investigation
2. **Investigation**: Our team investigates the vulnerability and assesses impact
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix for the vulnerability

### Security Best Practices

When using this project, please follow these security best practices:

#### API Keys and Secrets
- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use different API keys for different environments (dev/staging/prod)

#### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date using Dependabot
- Review security advisories for all dependencies
- Use `safety` and `bandit` tools for security scanning

#### Configuration
- Use the provided `.env.example` as a template
- Validate all configuration inputs
- Enable strict validation mode in production

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns

### Security Tools Integration

This project includes several security tools:

- **Bandit**: Static analysis for common security issues
- **Safety**: Checks for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates with security focus
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated security checks before commits

### Security Scanning

We run automated security scans as part of our CI/CD pipeline:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning with `safety`
- Static code analysis with `bandit`
- Automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- Security-focused code review process

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until they are fixed
- We will credit security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities
- We will maintain confidentiality during the investigation and fix process
- We will provide clear communication about security updates

### Security Contact

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities:

- **Email**: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **Repository Owner**: Contact @SatoryKono directly

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Patch versions** (e.g., 0.1.1) for security fixes
- **Security advisories** published on GitHub
- **Release notes** clearly marking security-related changes

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we appreciate security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities and may provide recognition for significant contributions.

### Security Changelog

Security-related changes are documented in:
- [CHANGELOG.md](docs/changelog.md)
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes for each version
