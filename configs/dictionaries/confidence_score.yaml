interpretations:
  -
    score: ">=8"
    meaning: "High-confidence single-protein mapping; recommended for strict filtering"
  -
    score: ">=4"
    meaning: "Protein target present; acceptable for broader analyses"
  -
    score: "0-1"
    meaning: "No/indirect target; exclude for target-specific potency"
rules:
  normalization: "coerce to int; range 0..9"
