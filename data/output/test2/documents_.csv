CHEMBL1121493,"The synthesis of 11-thiohomoaminopterin (1), which is a close analogue of 11-thiohomofolic acid (2), has been carried out by modification of the Boon-Leigh procedure. Treatment of 1-chloro-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiopenoxy]-2-butanone (5) with sodium azide gave 1-azido-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiophenoxy]-2-butanone (6). After protection of the carbonyl group of 6, the product 7 was catalytically hydrogenated to 1-amino-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiophenoxy]-2-butanone ketal (3). Reaction of 32 with 6-chloro-2,4-diaminmo-5-nitropyrimidine gave the desired pyrimidine intermediate, which was elaborated to 4-amino-4-deoxy-11-thiohomopteroic acid (20) by standard procedures. Alternately, 1-azido-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiophenoxy]-2-butanone ketal (7) was hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid (8) and coupled with diethyl L-glutamate to obtain diethyl N-[p-(1-azido-2-oxo-4-thiobutanoyl)benzoyl]-L-glutamate ketal (10), which was used for the large-scale preparation of 11-thiohomoaminopterin (1). Although 11-thiohomoaminopterin showed antifolate activity against two folate-requiring microorganisms and inhibited Lactobacillus casei dihydrogolate reductase, it did not exhibit any antitumor activity against L-1210 lymphoid leukemia in mice at a maximum dose of 48 mg/kg.","Gaumont Y, Strumpf D, Nair MG, Chen SY, Kisliuk RL",0.0,False,10.1021/jm00182a017,899,True,8,J Med Chem,903.0,8,6772788,Folate analogues altered in the C9-N10 bridge region. 16.

CHEMBL1121680,"Forty trimethoprim analogues in which the para substituent in the benzene ring was varied were prepared for antibacterial evaluation. All were very potent inhibitors of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. The similarity of their inhibitory activities strongly suggested that the side chains beyond the first two atoms were not in contact with the enzyme. However, among 38 ether derivatives which varied widely in their bulk and lipophilicity, very few approached trimethoprim in their broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activity. The 4'-methyl and 4'-ethyl analogues and the allyloxy and gamma-chloropropoxy ethers had activities fairly close to that of trimethoprim. The two ethers were chosen for further evaluation in vivo.
