description: Always apply core project invariants (determinism, schemas, logging, CI discipline)
globs:
alwaysApply: true

# PURPOSE
Enforce non-negotiable invariants across the whole repo so the agent does not guess.

# PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)
- Deterministic I/O: identical inputs+config produce bit-identical outputs. Use stable row/column order, UTC timestamps, canonical JSON, atomic writes.
- Validate-before-write: every table is validated against a Pandera schema with fixed column order. No writes on validation failure.
- Structured logging only via UnifiedLogger; no print(); include run context and mandatory fields.
- Tests: no network in unit tests; golden tests for critical outputs; property-based tests for transformations; coverage ≥ 85% in CI.
- API access only through UnifiedAPIClient with retry/backoff, rate limiting, circuit breaker and strict timeouts.
- One source → one public pipeline; use unified components (Logger, Writer, Client, Schema); follow extract→transform→validate→export.
- Secrets in env/secret manager only; typed configs via Pydantic; profiles for shared defaults; CI secret scanning enabled.
- Python style: ruff/black, isort, mypy --strict; no wildcard imports, no global mutable state, no magic numbers.

# WHEN TO USE
Always. Treat as global constraints for planning, codegen, edits and refactors.

# DO
- Refuse to emit write code without prior schema validation and deterministic sorting.
- Bind run context once, log with structured key-value.
- Fail fast on missing config or secret.
- Prefer composition over inheritance in components.

# DON'T
- Don't emit print(), ad-hoc logging, local time, non-atomic writes, or unordered CSV/JSON.
- Don't call external APIs outside UnifiedAPIClient or without throttling/retry policy.
- Don't bypass tests or lower coverage thresholds.
